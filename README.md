# Personal-Finance-Tracker
Created a web-based personal finance tracker using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application allow users to add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions and display the current balance. Use GitHub Copilot to guide you in implementing features, handling user input, and designing a responsive user interface.

# HTML
The HTML structure defines the basic layout of the personal finance tracker. It includes a header, a section to display the current balance, a section to list transactions, and a form to add new transactions.

# CSS
The CSS styles define the visual appearance of the tracker. It sets the font family, alignments, and margins for various elements such as headings, balance section, transaction list, and input form.

# JavaScript
The JavaScript code handles the logic behind adding transactions. It retrieves the description and amount input values, validates them, creates HTML elements to display the transaction, appends them to the transaction list, updates the balance, and clears the input fields.

That's it! This basic implementation allows users to add transactions and see their current balance. You can further enhance the application by adding features like editing and deleting transactions, saving data to localStorage, and providing a more interactive user interface.
